# Tumor Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Description:
This project aims to classify tumors as benign or malignant using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It is developed to analyze medical imaging data in the healthcare sector and assist in tumor diagnosis.

## Technologies Used:
- Python programming language
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm (scikit-learn library)
- NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries for data analysis and visualization

## Dataset:
The dataset used in the project contains tumor data obtained from medical imaging techniques such as MRI or X-ray. It includes various features of tumors (size, shape, texture, etc.) and the likelihood of a tumor being benign or malignant.

## Usage:
To run the project, you can execute the code in a local Python environment or in a Jupyter Notebook. After downloading the project files, you need to install the required libraries and load the dataset. Then, you can proceed to train and test the data using the KNN algorithm. The results will be presented in terms of accuracy rates and visualizations for classifying tumors as benign or malignant.

**Note:** This project should not be used for medical diagnosis purposes and is intended for educational and learning purposes only. For real medical conditions, consultation with expert doctors is necessary.
